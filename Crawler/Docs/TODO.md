# TODO
                  
## Big Ol' Bugs

* [ ] Wait needs to wait for any messages and then reschedule the player
* [ ] attack is off

## Missing Features

## Wish List
                                                                      
* [ ] Market views
* [ ] Better WeakReference - struct Weak<T>, forward object identity for utility
* [ ] Precalculate and cache more of the filtered segments lists (like ReactorSegments etc.)
                                  
## Finished

* [x] Use deterministic seeding like I should have from the start (2025-11-08)

* [x] Make a separate combat mode - improved scheduling
* [x] Change to 1-5 minute scheduling -- hourly max delay
* [x] Refactor generate fire and weapon segments to support fire rate.
* [ip 10-27] Improve and show prohibition states
* [ ] Need a --seed command line option
* [ ] Time not flowing properly outside of combat
* [ ] Improve the suffocation mechanic
* [ ] Change Passengers and Soldiers to a mid-game raw material and a late-game refined material
* [ ] Dynamic crawlers don't appear to be following the right seed - sometimes it will spawn with one in seed=1, sometimes one will appear after a few hours, and sometimes you starve first.
* [ ] dynamic crawlers are off
* [ ] Self-repair
