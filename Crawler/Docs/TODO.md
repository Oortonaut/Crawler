# TODO
                  
## Big Ol' Bugs

[_] Wait needs to wait for any messages and then reschedule the player
[_] Change Passengers and Soldiers to a mid-game raw material and a late-game refined material
[_] Improve the suffocation mechanic
[_] Dynamic crawlers don't appear to be following the right seed - sometimes it will spawn with one in seed=1, sometimes one will appear after a few hours, and sometimes you starve first.
## Missing Features

## Wish List
                                                                      
[_] Market views
[_] Better WeakReference - struct Weak<T>, forward object identity for utility
